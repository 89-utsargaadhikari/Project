    <Div class="port">

        <p>I wanted to learn coding since I was studying in Grade-8, but I have to confess I never tried to learn. It's hardly been two months since I started learning basics of html and css.
            I had a great time learning html and css. The basic html was really easy. I learned the starting basics from my college and my curiosity started to increase to I started to learn from scrimba.
        </p>
        <p>Was it hard? My experience in the beginning was quite exciting until I got to css padding and flexbox which gave me a headache before I grasped the concept, thanks to scrimba.com which helped me to understand the concept</p>
        
        <p>But I had a great time learning css animations, which I found really interesting and exciting. And there is always so much to learn in CSS.</p>
        <h2>Benefits of learning HTML and CSS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and css are easy to learn.</li>
            <li>HTML is supported by all the browsers.</li>
            <li>HTML is simple to edit.</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS are lightweight.</li>
            <li>HTMl and CSS are the base to any web applications a developer needs to master.</li>
        </ul>       

        <p>As conclusion, it's okay if you are trying to learn through tutorial videos and websites, but in my point of view you can only master HTML and CSS if you dedicate enough time to have troubles and solve them. You can never know much there is always so much to learn.
         And if you need some sites to learn HTML and CSS for free, you can visit
        <ul>
         <li>freecodecamp.org</li>
        <li>scrimba.com</li>

</ul>
